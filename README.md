# Binary-Heap-Tree-Python-implementation

A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property.

A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with two properties:
1) It is a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

2) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap.
In a Min Binary Heap, the min-heap property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to Min Heap.
 This repo is a python code that demostrates the implimentation of a binary haep tree
